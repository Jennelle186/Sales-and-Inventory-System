# Getting Started

This project was created using ReactJS with Material-UI as its main library for the design. Firebase was then used as its backend. 
A google drive link is also available for the step-by-step instructions with pictures on how to deploy the system. You may go to this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y2ke42PU9oxhNz5SeseAOZKuJ7H6ayBb/view?usp=sharing

## Index in Firestore for querying
According to the Firebase documentation, "Firebase provides powerful tools for ordering and querying your data. Specifically, Firebase allows you to do ad-hoc queries on a collection of nodes using any common child key. As your app grows, the performance of this query degrades. However, if you tell Firebase about the keys you will be querying, Firebase will index those keys at the servers, improving the performance of your queries.". Therefore, in this project, there are several webpages that needs this index querying. These are the following web pages:

    1. Pending Orders
    2. Ready to be Delivered Orders
    3. Delivered Orders
    4. History of the Products

Visiting these web pages, this will show as an error in the console, thereafter, you may just click on the link which will direct you to the Firebase project. Firebase will automatically build this index for you. For more information, you may click on the Google Drive link provided above and go to page 23 which includes pictures on what it loooks like. 



## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
